# Two-implementations-of-GANs
I implemented two versions of GANs for a my Maturit√§ts paper


The two implementations are written in Python with the framework Pytorch. 
I used the following sites for inspiration and marked snippets in the code that I reused. Note that the models are not very optimized for the best performance and were produced withe focus on a fair comparison.
